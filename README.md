# Kubernetes in Docker: The Workshop

You can run Kubernetes in Docker on the desktop, using Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows, and in production using Docker Enterprise Edition.

This half-day workshop will show you how to set up Kubernetes, how to work with your Kubernetes cluster, and how to leverage the Docker EE container platform to deploy secure applications in production.

The workshop starts with a short presentation, and the rest of the time is hands-on work.
